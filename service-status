OS= Ubuntu-18 lts

Place it in /etc/systemd/system folder with say a name of myfirst.service

[Unit]
Description=Spark service

[Service]
ExecStart=/path/to/spark/sbin/start-all.sh

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

Make that your script executable with:

chmod u+x /path/to/spark/sbin/start-all.sh
Start it:

sudo systemctl start myfirst
Enable it to run at boot:

sudo systemctl enable myfirst
Stop it:

###Service###

#!/bin/bash
#Aurthur="Muhammad Asim"
#Purpose="Jira service stops, when an AMI is taken, to avoid delays restart automation of Jira is done"

ACTIVE=`systemctl status jira | grep -w active | awk '{print $2}'`
START=`systemctl start jira`

echo "$ACTIVE" > /dev/null

if [ "$ACTIVE" = "active" ]
then
        #echo $?
        echo "Jira is running" > /dev/null
else
        echo "$START"


fi


#END

######

Note: Cron-Job you can set for min 5 minutes, but here I want to check the status of service every 5 seconds, so while loop is mentioned below.

#!/bin/bash

while true
do
sleep 5

/root/bash/jira.sh

done

#END
